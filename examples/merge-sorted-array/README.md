## Merge sorted array

This algorithm performs an in-place merge of two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 into the first array nums1. The merge starts from the end of both arrays, and elements are compared and placed in their correct positions in nums1. If there are still elements in nums2 that are greater than the elements in nums1, they are placed in their appropriate positions.
