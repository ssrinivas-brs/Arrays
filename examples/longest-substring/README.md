## Longest Substring

This algorithm finds the length of the longest substring in a given string with no repeating characters. It uses a sliding window approach to efficiently track the current substring. It maintains a set to store unique characters within the window. As the window expands, it checks for duplicates and shrinks the window from the left to eliminate duplicates. The algorithm returns the length of the longest substring found.
