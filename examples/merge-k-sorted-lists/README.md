## Merge k sorted lists

This algorithm is an implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm for merging k sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list. It utilizes a helper function to recursively divide the list of linked lists into smaller parts and then merges them using the merge function, which combines two sorted linked lists into one. The main function mergeKLists calls the helper function to merge all the lists into a single sorted linked list and returns the head of the merged list.
