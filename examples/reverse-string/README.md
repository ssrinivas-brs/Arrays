## Reverse String

This algorithm reverse String is used to reverse an input string s in-place. It employs the "mirror image" approach, where it swaps the first and last characters, then the second and second-to-last characters, and so on until it reaches the middle of the string. This process effectively reverses the original string. The algorithm returns the reversed string.
